This repository will run through a number of tests on the Rocketmiles.com website

The tests in the repository were created on a Windows 10 laptop with the following software:
- IntelliJ
- Selenium
- Chrome v78.0.3904.108
- Chromedriver v78.0.3904.105

To properly run the tests, you should have a fairly recent version of Chrome and ChromeDriver loaded on your system

The tests can be run by issues a gradle command for:
gradlew test

It may be slightly different on a Mac:
./gradlew test

The tests are located in src/test/java/website/
They are divided based on function/page. There are a few tests for the Index page specifically, some test with different search parameters, and some tests for functionality on the results page

The page objects are located in src/main/java/pages/

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you for your time
